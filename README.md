PROJECT : IEU CINEMA

Topic and Aim of the Project

The project is a movie theater tracking system. It is specific to a certain area, just like software created for the control of tables and accounts used in restaurants. It simulates the events of a day in a movie theater and helps to extract some statistics. It provides its users with many other statistics such as how many customers visit the movie theater in a day, which movie is watched the most or which sessions are most full (morning-lunch-evening).
